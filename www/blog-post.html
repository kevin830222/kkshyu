There are several methods of inheritance in Javascript, one of the more straight-forward being Prototype Chaining.  I want to explore each of these methods to moreso solidify them in my own brain, and hopefully help others to understand them as well.  I'll be using a Sesame Street theme, as my son Jack's obsession with it has the show playing over and over in my head.  So perhaps this can be cathartic.

Let's check out the usual chaining code pattern. First we define the parent constructor <code>Puppet</code>. As you know, a constructor is just a function that creates objects. Within the <code>Puppet</code> constructor we define the <code>name</code> property.
<div class="snippet">
<pre>var Puppet = function(name) {
 this.name = name;
};</pre>
Next we can add a couple methods to <code>Puppet.prototype</code>.  Then we can use the method <code>.sayHi</code> on an instance of the Puppet class if we want.
<pre>Puppet.prototype.talk = function(){
 console.log("Oh, hi!");
};

Puppet.prototype.sayHi = function(){
 console.log("Hi, I'm " + this.name + "!");
};

var puppet1 = new Puppet('Elmo');
var puppet2 = new Puppet('Grover');

puppet1.sayHi(); // this logs "Hi, I'm Elmo!"</pre>
Now let's start setting up the Prototype Chain. We want to start fleshing out Elmo a little more, so instead of relying on a <code>Puppet</code> instance, let's define an <code>Elmo</code> constructor as a child class of our <code>Puppet</code> constructor. This will allow us to set Elmo apart from the basic <code>Puppet</code> class.  We're going to call the parent constructor <code>Puppet</code> with <code>Puppet.call</code> to make sure that '<code>this</code>' is referencing it. On the next line we'll initialize an Elmo-specific property.
<pre>function Elmo(name, mood) {
  Puppet.call(this, name);
  this.mood = mood;
};</pre>
Now we can chain these prototypes together using <code>Object.create</code>.
<pre>Elmo.prototype = Object.create(Puppet.prototype);</pre>
Then we set the <code>Elmo.prototype.constructor</code> property to reference our <code>Elmo</code> constructor, adding a new <code>sayHi</code> method that is unique to Elmo. [note: <em>Elmo always refers to himself in the 3rd person. Don't ask me how I know.</em>]
<pre>Elmo.prototype.constructor = Elmo;

Elmo.prototype.sayHi = function(){
  console.log("Hello, Elmo is " + this.name + ". Elmo is usually " + this.mood + ".");
};</pre>
Now let's try to call a function on the new Elmo prototype.
<pre>var daytimeElmo = new Elmo("Elmo", "manic");

daytimeElmo.sayHi();  // this logs "Hello, Elmo is Elmo. Elmo is usually manic."</pre>
We've now successfully chained our child class <code>Elmo</code> to our parent class <code>Puppet</code>. We can now add as many unique properties to the <code>Elmo</code> class as we want without affecting the <code>Puppet </code>class. What's more, if we have further methods or properties that we want to apply to all puppets, then we can add them to our parent class and <code>Elmo</code> will inherit them.
